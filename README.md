## Project Information

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.


To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality


For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).


## Contributing

This was based on a repository for _all_ Udacity students. Original repository: https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game

## Idea

The idea of that website is to create an old and known classic of cards games: *Memory Game*

## How It Works

As a start, a **popup window** appears, that lets you start the game (and with that, a timer).


Afterwards, the cards are **randomized** and put onto the _deck_.


A **move counter** tells you what rating you are currently getting. (3, 2 or 1 star)


A **restart button** in the top right corner lets you restart whenever you want to.


As soon as a match was found, the color of the cards change and they stay open, while the game continues.


And finally, as soon as every match was found, a popup window appears, giving you your move-count, your time and an option to restart.

## Additions

As an addition, **animate.css** was added to the css files, to allow a smooth animation of the cards.

## Special Thanks

To Udacity for making that all possible!
